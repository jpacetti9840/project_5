	  <h1>Favorite Places to Travel</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/t_l.png" width="200" height="135" alt="image of two dogs"><span style="font-family: neonoir, sans-serif; font-size: 20pt;">Traveling is one of my favorite things to do and I've been to so many cool places.</span> I have been to Colorado, Canada, Barbuda, Wyoming, and Montana, just to name a few.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>I love flying because it is so much faster and a really cool experience.&nbsp; The first time I went on a plane it was the summer of fourth grade and I had just read the book "Hatchet" by Gary Paulsen. "Hatchet" is a great book but it made me terrified to go on a plane because it was about a plane crash. But once I got on the plane, I loved it!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>One of my favorite trips ever is when I went to Quebec and Montreal in Canada. My dad's cousin and her family live in Canada so we went up to visit them one yea. We flew into New York and drove to Lake Placid (one of the prettiest places ever!) and stayed there for a few days. Then we went to Montreal and stayed with our family as the showed us around. Montreal is a French speaking part of Canada so my cousins are fluent in English and French! Once we left Montreal we went to Quebec and stayed in the Fairmont Le&nbsp;Ch√¢teau Frontenac which was like a castle! They had a dog that was always in the lobby named Daphney and she was adorable! After we left Canada we went to Bar Harbor, Maine for a few day and it was really fun! I went on my favorite hiking trail ever, it was called the Bee Hive Trail and you climb up the side of a mountain and there are rungs in the mountain that you climb and there wasn't an railing. After Maine we came back home, exhausted for the about 2 week trip but it is definitely one of my favorites!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	  <h1>My Dogs&nbsp;</h1>
	  <p><img src="../images/t_l.png" width="200" height="135" alt="image of two dogs"><span style="font-family: neonoir, 'sans-serif;'; font-size: 20pt;">I have two dogs named Leia and Toby.</span> Leia is a 15 year old beagle boston terrier mix&nbsp; and I have had her since I was 3 years old. My brother named her after Princess Leia from Star Wars. My other dog Toby is a two year old mini-bernedoodle that I got as a surprise for Christmas two years ago. Since my brother named Leia, I got to choose Toby's name. Dogs are one of my favorite animals!&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;Leia is very chill and relaxed and Toby is insanely crazy and energetic.           Leia sleeps a lot&nbsp; and Toby wants to play all the time so it can get&nbsp; a little hectic  but they are the best!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

My dad's side of the family lives about an hour away from us and it is a lot of fun to go there as well! I have 8 cousins and 3 aunts and 3 uncles. In total they have 5 dogs, 2 guinea pigs, and 2 cats. My uncle also works on a farm where they have a lot of horses and cows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>One of my favorite places to go is Danville Kentucky becuase I have so much family ther. One of my favorite memories is when I got to go to a Kentucky basketball game in Rupp Arena. I went with my cousn, mom, and aunt, it was a great game and so much fun!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
